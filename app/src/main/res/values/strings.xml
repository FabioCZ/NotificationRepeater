    <string name="home_about">MIUI 10 has issues showing notifications from some apps. The notifications from those troubled apps are recognized by the system, but they are immediately dismissed because there is an error showing the notification UI. This app will intercept those notifications, and re-show using a generic UI. Please post issues to <a href="https://github.com/FabioCZ/NotificationRepeater">github.com/FabioCZ/NotificationRepeater</a> or PM me at /u/FabioCZ</string>
